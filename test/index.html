<p id="block-24"><strong>29 min:</strong> After that let-off, Portugal tear down the other end and sow panic in the Brazilian defence, Juan forced into a clusmy-looking tackle on Tiago, who tumbles theatrically. Portugal players howl for a penalty, the ref books Tiago for diving. </p><!-- Block 23 --><p id="block-23"><strong>28 min:</strong> Portugal switch off defensively, allowing Nilmar to collect a through-ball and shoot from eight yards. The keeper pushes it on to the psot and out! Great save. "Klose ..." blurts David Roberts. "... but no cigar."</p><!-- Block 22 --><p id="block-22"><strong>24 min:</strong> Juan cynically handles the ball mid-way inside the Brazilian half to prevent Cristiano Ronaldo from latching on to a long ball over the top. The Portuguese are furious and surround the ref demanding he send him off ... but the ref shows only yellow, both to Juan and to Duda, whose protestations were well over-the-top. "Good game, Alex," nods James Cotton. "For a topical one, how's about Dunga…rees."</p><!-- Block 21 --><p id="block-21"><strong>22 min:</strong> Portugal are just seeking to contain now.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p id="block-20"><strong>19 mins:</strong> Ronaldo show terrific speed to beat Juan to the ball down the left and, after all that, wins a throw-in. It's quickly taken but Brazil quickly clear. THey rumbled forward anew .. as Ivory Coast go 2-0 up in the other game, hinting that Portugal could be in trouble if they lose here.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p id="block-19"><strong>17 min:</strong> Portugal get some joy down the left, this time through Meireles, who pulls it back to Tiago at the edge of the area. He shanks his shot wide.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p id="block-18"><strong>16 min:</strong> Ivory Coast are 1-0 up against North Korea and Rob Smyth tells me they should be about four goals in front already. He reckons the nine-goal swing might just be on. "Players that make you say things after they're names are said," introduces Alex Warwick. "I'll start. Agger do,do,do. Mendoza (in the voice of McBail from the Simpsons). Heskey, misses.  This is a lot of fun."</p><!-- Block 17 --><p id="block-17"><strong>14 min:</strong> Buccaneering run down the left by Coentrao, who dug out a fine cross taht Julio Cesar punched clear under duress. In the rush to pick up the pieces, Luis Fabiano mows down Costa and cops a booking.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p id="block-16"><strong>11 min:</strong> Brazil are pressing energetically, winning the ball back off Portugal whenever they lose it so they can resume their probing. They're well on top. Meanwhile, Lawrence Errol is a devout Pele fan and is on a mission to convert you, too. "How about a gol against Fluminense which was the origin of the term 'gol da placa'; how about a performance against Benfica in the World Club Championship that was the greatest act of destruction ever wrought against a team by a single player; how about a 15 minute destruction of England in 1965; the defenestration of Wales in 1959; do I need to go on?  Put hand in your pocket and buy the Pele Eterno dvd.  Then you might begin to understand why there has never been a player remotely in Pele's class."</p><!-- Block 15 --><p id="block-15"><strong>9 min:</strong> Maicon spots Nilmar on the dash behind Ricardo Costa, but the forward failed to get the ball under control and Eduardo hared off his line to smother. It's all Brazil so far.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p id="block-14"><strong>8 min:</strong> "Here's Lucio, a fine, broad-shouldered defender ... but he does tend to wriggle and squeal a bit under the tackle." Whatever is BBC's Jonathan Pearce talking about?</p><!-- Block 13 --><p id="block-13"><strong>6 min:</strong> Baptista rolls the ball to Dani Alves some 26 yards out. He has time and space in which to shoot, so does so, banging it way wide.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p id="block-12"><strong>5 min:</strong> Luis Fabiano clatters Pepe on half-way, and then disingenuously rollicks him for simulation, which makes Luis Fabiano guilty of simulation.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p id="block-11"><strong>3 min:</strong> Girly squeals all around the ground as you-know-who gets his first touch. You'd think he'd be used to it by now, but it seeemed to put him off ... and he allowed the ball to run away from him and straight to Lucio.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p id="block-10"><strong>2 min:</strong> No sign of the sides setting out for a draw here - Brazil win a corner in the first few seconds. But Dani Alves's delivery is feeble and Meireles heads it away at the near post.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p id="block-9"><strong>1 min:</strong> Brazil are go!</p><!-- Block 8 --><p id="block-8"><strong>National anthem:</strong> Nice number there from Portugal, uplifting in a sinister sort of way, as if written by an Iberian Darth Vader. The Brazilian one is more consciously jolly - either cute or irritating, depending on your mood.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p id="block-7"><strong>2:54pm:</strong> "Just wondering whether anyone has ever seen Dunga and Christophe Lambert in the same room together," just wonders Jonathan Oliver-McCauley, whose name I don't want. "I guess they're odds-on favourites to win as there can be only one."</p><!-- Block 6 --><p id="block-6"><strong>2:52pm:</strong> "Your premable is probably correct," confirms Otis Farnsworth, whose name I want. "It does, however, assume that my prediction for tonight's games doesn't come to fulfilment: Spain beat Chile in a fabulous, yet profligate 1-0 battle, whilst Switzerland forget the point of their match and bore the stadium to death in a goalless, chanceless encounter, thereby ensuring that two of my favourite teams go through, and more hideous anti-football is consigned to Greek/French dustbin. I can but hope." We can but join you.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p id="block-5"><strong>2:50pm:</strong> A propos of nothing, let's have none of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ioyt2zzm530">this</a> today.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p id="block-4"><strong>2:47pm:</strong> "Fantasy football decisions - Maicon or Dani Alves for this game?" wonders Stephen Rushe. I'm saying Maicon. Even his name sounds more menacing.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p id="block-3"><strong>2:45pm:</strong> BBC are showing a compilation of the highlights of Pele's career - you know, the same few shots we've seen many, many times before. He was before my time so I ask any of you who've been riding the earth for longer than me to tell us all about something special he did besides those familiar clips? And without the aid of Viagara.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p id="block-2"><strong>Preamble:</strong>  These may well be the best two defences in the tournament – excluding gravediggers such as Switzerland, who set out en masse to kill games – and a draw would usher them both into the next round. So does that mean we're destined for the deadest of rubbers? Surely not, because there is a mighty big carrot for the team that tops this group – or rather, a big non-stick: the group winners will avoid Spain or Chile, and have the pleasure of giving the Swiss what for.</p><p>Julio Baptista replaces Kaka, as you can see form the teams below, but more intriguingly, it looks like Portugal are going to stick Cristiano Ronaldo up front. That's an interesting move by Carlos Queiroz - he's done it before but not to particularly pleasing effect and his decision to revert to it comes, curiously, after the team finally seeemd to have solved its scoring problems by recording the biggest win in their history. Queiroz seems to be suggesting that they should have hit more than seven against North Korea. That's the spirit!</p><!-- Block 1 --><p id="block-1"><strong>Teams:</strong><br /><strong>Portugal:</strong> 1-Eduardo; 2-Bruno Alves, 6-Ricardo Carvalho, 15-Pepe, 23-Fabio Coentrao, 21-Ricardo Costa, 16-Raul Meireles, 19-Tiago, 7-Cristiano Ronaldo, 5-Duda, 10-Danny. </p><p><strong>Brazil:</strong> 1-Julio Cesar; 2-Maicon, 3-Lucio, 4-Juan, 6-Michel Bastos, 5-Felipe Melo, 8-Gilberto Silva, 13-Dani Alves, 21-Nilmar, 19-Julio Baptista, 9-Luis Fabiano. </p><p><strong>Referee:</strong> Benito Archundia (Mexico) </p><p><strong>A slightly ironic thing:</strong> Status Quo's biggest hit was called The Wanderer.  (Mind you, he did just "go round and round and round and round" so sounds like he never actually went anwyhere. Not a slightly ironic thing, then, just a very silly vagrant).</p>
