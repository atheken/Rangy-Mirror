- Write IE test for Range boundaries when switching between TextRange and WrappedRange (seems to change after a couple of iterations)
- Investigate IE 9 crash: seems to happen on cloneContents 1 test in the second suite
- Add option to use DoMRange rather than WrappedRange in selection? Is this necessary?
- Add more selection tests
- Check range passed to removeRange, addRange in selection. Possibly convert TextRange/ControlRange to WrappedRange?
